 - Phase 7 — Playlists: Partial (styles done, behavior wiring added client-side via `public/js/playlist-dnd.js`)
- Phase 8 — Micro-interactions: Done (reduced-motion + progress)

Pending / Needs cleanup or follow-up:
- `public/css/theme-base.css`: cleaned and overwritten, but run project CSS lint/typecheck and visually verify across pages. Ensure no legacy tokens remain in other CSS files.
- Templates: additional templates (datatables, dashboards, mediapool, playlists) should be updated to use new class names where necessary.
- JS behaviors: mobile menu toggle, menu aria-expanded updates, datatable toolbar interactions, drag-and-drop behaviors are not yet added.

- Update: added mobile menu toggle and dropdown aria behavior to `public/js/main.js` (wired to `#mobileMenuToggle`, `#mainMenu`, and buttons with `aria-haspopup`).
 - Update: expanded design tokens (spacing, radii, shadows, font sizes, line-heights) and added button variants, form-grid variants, dialog/backdrop styles to `public/css/theme-base.css`.
 - Update: modernized `templates/dashboard.mustache` with page header, `.dashboards` container and `.dashboard-stats` placeholders.
 - Update: wired datatable toolbar interactions (per-page select, pager links) in `public/js/main.js` to submit `#form_elements_search` correctly.
- Update: Phase 6 — improved `public/css/mediapool/overview.css` (responsive `.media-grid`, `.media-item` cards, touch-friendly buttons and upload UI).
- Update: Phase 7 — improved playlist CSS (`public/css/playlists/overview.css`, `public/css/playlists/settings.css`) with card styles, DnD visuals and responsive layout.
- Update: Added `public/js/playlist-dnd.js` and imported it in `templates/layouts/main_layout.mustache` to auto-enable client-side reordering; it updates a hidden `playlist_order` input on reorder.
- Accessibility & QA: initial accessibility improvements implemented; full audit pending manual review.
- Visual regression testing: test strategy documented in `test-strategy.md`; screenshot comparison pipeline planned.
- CSS build pipeline: integrated PostCSS (autoprefixer & cssnano) with `npm run build:css` and Makefile `build-css` target.
- UI enhancements: modernized header/navigation layout and dashboard template for Enplug-like styling.
- Documentation: updated `docs/ui-style.md` with style guide updates; migration guide documented in `docs/migration.md`.

Status: near completion — code and documentation tasks completed; pending manual QA, testing, and compliance verification.
